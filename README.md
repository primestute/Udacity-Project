## (Borrower and The Factors that affect them)

## Dataset

> Loan Data from Prosper: This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The objectives of this project are to summarize the characteristics of features that have effect on the interest rate and to get some ideas about the relationships among multiple features using summary statistics and data visualizations


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found out that the interest rate is negatively correlated with monthly loan payment and prosper score. The borrower APR also decreases with the increasingly better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR. But people with lower ratings tend to borrow less money, decreasing APR could encourage them to borrow more.
Further more, I discovered that there is low interest rate for higher credit grade and higher interest rate for lower credit grade and on the average, the interest rate for the borrower that are home owners is higher than those that are not



## Key Insights for Presentation
> * The average borrower rate for a higher credit grade AA is lower than others.
> * The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate.
> * There is a positive correlation between Monthly Loan Payment and prosper score
> * For both Home owner and those who do not own home, the borrower Rate increases with the increase for people with HR-C raings. But for people with B-AA ratings, the rate decreases. However, the interest rate for home owner is lower than those that do not own home.
